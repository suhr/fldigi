\tableofcontents

Thor is a new forward error correcting incremental frequency shift keyed
communications mode.  It was developed specifically to meet the needs of ARQ
transfers in the HF spectrum.  It is particularly well suited under
conditions of atmospheric static noise.  Thor borrows from two current modem
technologies, \ref mfsk_page "MFSK" and \ref domino_ex_page "DominoEX".
<br>

Thor emits a distinctive double rising tone sequence at the
beginning of each transmission.  It is used to flush the receive
decoder and also provides a visual and audible clue to its being used.
<br>

The modem code for Thor uses a wide band multiple frequency
detector that can lock on and detect the incoming signal even when
badly mistuned.  Frequency domain oversampling is used to allow
proper tone detection without the need for AFC.  The AFC control does
not alter the decoder in any way.

The fldigi implementation of the Thor modem includes the ability to send and
receive images and avatars.  The default avatar is the "Tux" logo.  
Sending, receiving and saving avatars is discussed in the avatar section.
<br>

The waterfall and digiscope will appear as:
<br>

\image html Thor-1.png "Thor"
\image latex Thor-1.png "Thor" width=6.0in
<br>

The text displayed in the status area is the secondary text being sent by the
transmitting station.  When the keyboard buffer is empty the Thor modem
transmits text from the secondary text buffer.  Your secondary text buffer
can be edited on the Thor configuration tab.
<br>

The digiscope display is similar to the DominoEX display and represents the
tone pairs moving through the tone filters.  You can also use an alternate
digiscope display (left click on the digiscope display area).
<br>

In this display mode the red line represents the center of the multiple
tone bins that are in the detector.  The dots will be blurry if the AFC is
not locked on and become very distinct when AFC lock has been achieved.  The
tone dots will move from bottom to top (opposite the direction of the
waterfall).

\section THORimage Thor Image Mode

fldigi-thor can send and receive images and avatars when the modem is set to 11, 16 or 22 baud.

Small digital images are selected from those stored on the disk.  The image 
transmission is similar to but not compatible with the IFKP image mode.  
Thor images are always transmitted in a fixed width to height ratio.  
The W x H format is not limited to a single ratio, nor is it limited to just 
color, or just gray scale.  Thor transmits the image in Blue-Green-Red
order.  The thor image bandwidth is the same as the signal bandwidth for
for Thor mode in use.

The start of the picture is signalled digitally, and the receiver simply captures 
data continuously for W lines of H pixels, as requested, resulting in a WxH pixel 
image, then reception stops.

A brief period of silence, followed by a sync signal will be transmitted at the
beginning of each image or avatar.  The sync signal is used to align the start of
the received image.  This is the equivalent of a vertical sync signal in an
analog television signal.  There is no equivalent of horizontal sync, therefore
there is no risk of the picture tearing due to timing changes, or breaking up 
during selective fades. All that happens is that the image may noise up momentarily, 
but will stay correctly aligned.

<b>Image Format</b>

The images are approximately in 4:3 or 3:4 aspect ratio.  thor images can be received
by any thor capable decoder.

Available image aspect ratios / formats include:

<ul>
<li>59x74   color
<li>160x120 color
<li>320x240 color
<li>640x480 grey scale
<li>640x480 color
<li>240x300 color
<li>240x300 grey scale
<li>120x150 color
<li>120x150 grey scale
</ul>

These formats correspond roughly to a portrait (3x4) and landscape (4x3) photo.
fldigi will scale any computer stored image to the target image.  You should
edit the images off line to be at least close to the 3x4 or 4x3 ratio.  That will
prevent the fldigi loader from distorting the loaded image.

The image mode sampling rate is the same as the base baud samplerate:
<ul>
<li>Thor-11  11025 samples/sec</li>
<li>Thor-16   8000 sampels/sec</li>
<li>Thor-22  11025 sampels/sec</li>
</ul>

Each pixel consists of 10 samples, and there are P pixels/line. Therefore the 
line period is 10 x P/sample-rate seconds, or the line rate sample-rate/(10 x P) lines/sec. 
In colour, each line is sent three times, in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) order.

The is a single sync signal sent at the beginning of each image is a tone placed 186 Hz 
below the center frequency. The sync signal is 20 symbol lengths of silence followed by
20 symbol lengths of the tone.

If the sound cards in the transmitting and receiving computers differ markedly 
in sample rate, the resulting picture can be skewed. A small timing 
difference is enough to cause a noticeable slant in the picture. This is easily 
fixed after reception using the Slant control. High quality sound cards should 
be better than 5ppm, and result in barely noticeable slant, but some cheaper 
computer built-in sound modules may be rather worse.  If you plan to send thor
images you should calibrate your sound card to WWV.  There should be no slant if 
both the transmit and receive sound cards are calibrated to WWV

<b>Transmit Image</b>

Transmitting an image in thor is initiated by selecting the "Send image" menu item
from the pop up Tx menu.  Right click on the Tx panel

<center>
\image html thor-send-image.png "Send Image"
\image latex thor-send-image.png "Send Image" width=2in
</center>

This selection opens up the Send Image dialog

<center>
\image html thor-image-xmt.png "Send Image Dialog"
\image latex thor-image-xmt.png "Send Image Dialog" width=3.5in
</center>

shown with a 160x120 color image loaded and ready to transmit.

Transmission begins when you press the "Xmt" button.  fldigi will insert the text
preamble and immediately begin the image transmission.  fldigi remains in transmit
mode when the image transmission is completed and the deadman timer is started.

There is an alternate way of sending an image, but one which only transmits a color
image with no provision for slant correction.  This may be more convenient
for sharing images when you do not need the additional utility of the image dialog.
<br>

Open a file folder to the location of your image files that are suitable for MFSK 
transmission.  These images should be constrained to be 240 x 200 or less for 
reasonable transmit times.  Optionally prepare fldigi for the MFSK image 
transmission by entering some suitable text to precede the transmission.  
You may be sending the image, blossoms.jpg, for example.  
<br>

<center>
\image html blossoms.png "image in files folder"
\image latex blossoms.png "image in files folder" width=3.0in
</center>

One might enter:

\image html blossoms-1.png ""
\image latex blossoms-1.png "" width=4.0in

Then drag and drop the the image file from the files folder to the transmit 
text panel in fldigi.  The program will automatically resize the image to the
nearest scale-aspect ratio less than or equal to the actual image size.
<br>

The TX panel text will then change to

\image html blossoms-2.png ""
\image latex blossoms-2.png "" width=4.0in

The ^! is the character sequence used by the fldigi TX parser to indicate 
that there is a pending execution command.  In this case it is to transmit 
the blossoms.jpg file.
<br>

Add some suitable ending text and the sequence ^r to the next line and 
then press the T/R button (if not already transmitting).  At the end of the 
image the TX parser will find the ^r and return the program to the receive 
mode.

The Rx panel will echo the transmitted data:
<br>
\image html thor-pic-transmission.png ""
\image latex thor-pic-transmission.png "" width=4.0in

The transmit progress dialog will close at the conclusion of the image transmission.

<b>Receive Image</b>

Reception is completely automatic.  The decoder will identify the picture start, 
and record the picture. In doing so, it automatically opens a separate "thor Rx Image" dialog.

<center>
\image html thor-image-partial.png "Image Reception"
\image latex thor-image-partial.png "Image Reception" width=6.0in
</center>

Demodulation uses a phase detection algorithm based on quadrature demodulation 
using the current and previous samples. All the samples are converted to pixels and stored, 
but only the average over every 10 samples is displayed.

The raw image is stored in a temporary buffer of expanded size, which allows 
fine adjustment of the slant and phase to be made before the image is sampled 
and displayed.

If the transmitting station goes off the air or reception is lost during 
recording of a picture, the recording will continue until the necessary number 
of samples has been made, then reception stops.

<center>
\image html thor-image-completed.png "Image Reception Completed"
\image latex thor-image-completed.png "Image Reception Completed" width=3.5in
</center>

The Rx Image dialog controls from left to right are:
- Reset: clears all rx data
- Phase adjustment: moves image left and right
- Slant adjustment: slews image diagonally
- Save: saves the image to the fldigi image folder with a date-time stamped file name
- Close: closes the image dialog

Image phase and slant should not be adjusted before the picture reception has 
finished, as then only part of the image will be corrected.

\section thor_avatars Avatars

Avatar images are 59 x 74 (width x height) color images that are associated with
a call sign.  The avatar images are stored in the folder

<pre>
C:\\Documents and Settings\\\<user\>\\fldigi.files\\avatars\\
C:\\Users\\\<user\>\\fldigi.files\\avatars\\
/home/\<user\>/.fldigi/avatars/
</pre>

as "png" images.

You should prepare an image file for your own call sign, in lower case.  For example

<pre>
/home/dave/.fldigi/avatars/w1hkj.png
</pre>

in a 4x5 aspect ratio, preferably in the 59x74 format, but any larger 4x5 image can be used.
fldigi will scale the image to 59x74 when it is read from the file.

You can send your avatar very simply by right clicking on the thor avatar.

If you receive an avatar from another station it will automatically be displayed in
the avatar box.  You should have previously entered the call sign of the other station in
the Call logging control.  Left clicking on the avatar will then save the image in the
avatars folder with the appropriate callsign.  The correct avatar will then be displayed
the next time you enter that call sign in the Call logging control.  This is an example
of a received avatar with timing misalignment.

<br>
<center>
\image html thor-avatar-1.png "received avatar"
\image latex thor-avatar-1.png "received avatar" width=1.0in
</center>
<br>

The received image may be misaligned left or right in the image box.  This is caused
by an error in the start timing of the reception.  You can realign the image using a
combination of SHIFT, CONTROL and LEFT/RIGHT mouse clicks on the image.  Be careful
to use either the SHIFT or CONTROL in combination with the mouse button.  Mouse left
and right click without the SHIFT/CONTROL will cause either a save or an own avatar
transmit to occur.

<pre>
CONTROL LEFT click  - move image left by 1 pixel
SHIFT   LEFT click  - move image left by 5 pixels

CONTROL RIGHT click - move image right by 1 pixel
SHIFT   RIGHT click - move image right by 5 pixels
</pre>

The same image after alignment.

<br>
<center>
\image html thor-avatar-2.png "received avatar"
\image latex thor-avatar-2.png "received avatar" width=1.0in
</center>
<br>

You will probably need to manage the avatar images using your OS file explorer.  Easy
access to the image folder is obtained by the menu item File/Folders.

The avatar image format is identical to the thor image 59x74 format.  If you receive
and save a 59x74 image you can always rename the saved image (date-time-stamped) to
a \"callsign.png\" in the avatar folder.
